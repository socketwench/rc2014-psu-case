# Power Base for the RC2014

The [rc2014](https://rc2014.co.uk/) is a retro styled z80 computer you build as a kit. Combined with the [Front Panel Kit](https://z80kits.com/shop/blue-box-front-panel-switch-and-led-for-romwbw/), you have a handsome machine!

But...wouldn't it be *better* if you could also have a little more room? Enough for a power supply, an HDMI adapter, or anything you can mount on a DIN rail?

Look no further!
